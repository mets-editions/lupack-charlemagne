        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and
            typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on

        <note type="tnote" n="1">25<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage places the ‘r’ in ‘ther’
            between brackets, but it is clearly present in the manuscript.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="2">121<space rend="indent1"/><p>I have emended ‘resteyne’ to ‘reteyne’
            (as the <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> suggests).</p></note>

            ‘wone’ to achieve something nearer a rhyme. Mills also so emends.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="4">315<space rend="indent1"/><p>I follow Herrtage and Mills in
            emending the ms. reading ‘age’ to ‘elde,’ which restores the rhyme.</p></note>

            sense here) to ‘By.’</p></note>

            English translation of the Latin term) refer to structural units within a poem. The
            divisions into passus or fitts are not regularly marked in the manuscript. At this point
            the manuscript reads ‘Prymus passus the first Fytt.’ This probably marks the end of the
            first passus and the beginning of the second. The passus beginning at line 814 is
            indicated in the manuscript without a number.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="8">408<space rend="indent1"/><p>I follow Mills in emending ms. ‘lawe’
            to ‘laye,’ which restores the rhyme.</p></note>

            probably ‘a corruption of <hi rend="italic">avenaunt</hi>’ (meaning ‘gracious’ or
            ‘noble’ here) which appears in different forms in lines 807 and 917. Mills emends the
            ms. by deleting ‘on.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="12">935<space rend="indent1"/><p>In this line I follow Mills’
            reconstruction rather than Herrtage’s (‘For[th to Mela]yne’). The line in the manuscript
            clearly begins with a <hi rend="italic">B</hi>.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="13">1286<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage takes ‘gones’ as an
            alternate form of ‘gomes’ (men). Mills emends to ‘gomes.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="14">Before 1363<space rend="indent1"/><p>At least one leaf of the
          manuscript is lost at this point. In the missing lines, Charlemagne apparently tells one
          of his knights to ride to France for help.</p></note>
