        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and
            typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on

        <note type="tnote" n="2">11<space rend="indent1"/><p>The ‘ne’ is not in the manuscript, but
            the sense of the line requires it.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="3">202<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘than,’ but, as Hausknecht
            suggested, ‘thay’ seems the correct reading.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="4">360<space rend="indent1"/><p>The <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in ‘Pope’
            is illegible in the ms.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="5">369–70<space rend="indent1"/><p>There is a blank line in the ms.
            between these lines, and the sense suggests that something has been omitted
          here.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="6">473<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests reading ‘thus was
            it done’ or ‘this was i-done.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="7">500<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests emending ‘Ho’ to
            ‘We’; but ‘Ho’ as a variant of the adverb ‘o’ (meaning ‘continually’ or ‘ever’) is a
            possible reading.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="8">551<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘thoughe.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="9">650<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘met,’ probably an error for
            ‘mot.’ (A similar error occurs in line 2433.)</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="10">716<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘religes,’ as it does again
            in line 1821.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="11">1025<space rend="indent1"/><p>The sense suggests that there is a
            gap of one or more lines after line 1025, though nothing in the manuscript indicates the
            omission.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="12">1154<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘and thenkes.’ Hausknecht
            suggested the emendation to ‘as thenketh’ (‘as it seems’).</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="13">1179–80<space rend="indent1"/><p>In the ms. line 1179 reads
            ‘Olyvere him hitte agayn upon the hede’; then there is a blank space at the beginning of
            line 1180, followed by the words ‘the hede than full sore.’ Hausknecht suggests emending
            the lines to appear as they do above in the text. His emendation restores the
          rhyme.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="14">1341<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests that ‘alle’ in
            line 1341 is an error for ‘half.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="15">1361<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests reading ‘se’ for
            ‘sene’ in order to restore the rhyme.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="16">1423<space rend="indent1"/><p>I have followed Hausknecht’s
            suggestion in emending ms. ‘cowthe’ to ‘caughte’ and have also emended ms. ‘Be’ to
            ‘But.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="17">1645<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘harme skathe’ rather than
            ‘harme and skathe.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="18">1816<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests emending
            ‘byleved’ to ‘byleven’ (which would restore the rhyme).</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="19">1885<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests emending ‘he’ to
            ‘ye’; but reading ‘he’ in the sense of ‘a man’ or ‘someone’ allows us to maintain the
            manuscript reading.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="20">1967–68<space rend="indent1"/><p>These two lines are written as
            one in the manuscript.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="21">2033<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘While thay mery drinkyng.
            . . .’ Hausknecht is probably correct in suggesting that ‘mery’ is miswritten for
            ‘were.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="22">2042<space rend="indent1"/><p>I have followed Hausknecht in
            reading ‘stronde’ for the ms. ‘strowde.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="23">2085<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggested reading ‘Assye’
            for the ms. ‘Assyne.’ This is surely the right reading, as it restores the
          rhyme.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="24">2224<space rend="indent1"/><p>The ‘u’ in ‘Thou’ does not appear in
            the ms. I follow Hausknecht in adding it.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="25">2384<space rend="indent1"/><p>In Hausknecht’s edition the line
            reads ‘And assaye howe it wole it be.’ The second ‘it’ is not in the manuscript and is
            clearly a misprint in the edition.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="26">2421<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht suggests that ‘also’
            should begin line 2422.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="27">2433<space rend="indent1"/><p>The ms. ‘mete’ is probably an error
            for ‘mote’ (the emendation Hausknecht made).</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="28">2477<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hausknecht is probably correct in
            suggesting that ms. ‘and now’ should read ‘i-now.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="29">2558<space rend="indent1"/><p>I follow Hausknecht in emending ms.
            ‘Thile’ to ‘While.’ The Roxburghe Club edition, however, reads ‘Thile’ as a contraction
            for ‘the while.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="30">2650<space rend="indent1"/><p>I follow Hausknecht in emending
            ‘Gamylokes’ to ‘Gavylokes.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="31">2689–90<space rend="indent1"/><p>I follow Hausknecht in emending
            the ms. reading: ‘Thay thanked god that thay him hadde / Gyfen thaye such grace to
            spede.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="32">2694<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ms. reads ‘alaye.’</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="33">2885<space rend="indent1"/><p>The <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in
            ‘dyvers’ does not appear in the ms. Hausknecht suggested the addition.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="34">2951<space rend="indent1"/><p>French and Hale emend Hausknecht’s
            ‘Euer the founte’ to ‘Over the frounte’ (over the forehead). The ms. does, in fact, read
            ‘frounte,’ which is the reading of the Roxburghe Club edition. Reading ‘frounte’ makes
            the emendation of ‘Ever’ to ‘over’ even more plausible.</p></note>
        <note type="tnote" n="35">3127–28<space rend="indent1"/><p>The two lines are written as one
            in the ms.</p></note>
