        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

      <div type="text">
        <note type="enote" n="1">19<space rend="indent1"/><p>Here, as often in this text, ‘gon’ or
            the alternate spelling ‘gan’ (past tense of ‘gin,’ [‘to begin’]) is used as an auxiliary
            (like ‘did’ in more modern times) indicating the past tense of a verb. Thus ‘gon he wyn’
            means ‘he conquered.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">169<space rend="indent1"/><p>Ganelon is the traditional traitor of
            the Charlemagne romances. In <hi rend="italic">The Song of Roland</hi> his hatred for
            Roland leads him to betray Charlemagne’s rear guard at Roncevalles.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">395<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Mahownn’ is Mohammed, whom medieval
            Christians believed was worshipped by the Saracens as a deity.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">406<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Goddis’ is the singular possessive
            form depending on the noun ‘forbode’ (a forbidding or prohibition). ‘Goddis forbode’ =
            ‘God forbid!’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">416a<space rend="indent1"/><p>Metrically this is an extra line in
            the stanza. Mills sees the line as another example of the ‘triplets’ which are used
            instead of couplets ‘quite often in the Thornton text of <hi rend="italic"
            >Isumbras</hi>’ (p. 193). But the line remains an aberration in the metrical pattern of
              <hi rend="italic">The Sege of Melayne</hi>. A ‘bale-fire’ is a blazing pile or heap
            kindled to consume something.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">420<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘So mote I gone’ is one of those near
            meaningless expressions often used to fill out a line in the Middle English metrical
            romances.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">471<space rend="indent1"/><p>The reference is to the elements or
            four substances (earth, air, fire, and water) which were believed to make up all
            material things.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">506<space rend="indent1"/><p>On St. Denis, see the note to <hi
              rend="italic">Sowdone of Babylone</hi>, line 27.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">516<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Prime’ is the canonical hour (a fixed
            part of the Divine Office to be sung or recited at a specific time) for the first hour
            of the day (6 a.m. or sunrise).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">577<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage notes that ‘syne’ must be a
            corrupt reading ‘but the true reading is not clear.’ Mills emends to ‘fyne.’ ‘Syne’ must
            be a form of ‘son,’ the unusual spelling being for the sake of rhyme. It is perfectly
            appropriate for Charlemagne to refer to his nephew as the son of his
          relative.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">603<space rend="indent1"/><p>If we translate ‘bot’ as ‘but’ in
            this line, ‘it’ must refer to the cursing of the advisor, in which case the line
            translates: ‘and undoubtedly it [cursing him] is right.’ Another (though less likely)
            possibility is to read ‘bot’ as a form of ‘boute’ (meaning ‘about’) and translate: ‘and
            nothing about it [the advice] is right.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">704<space rend="indent1"/><p>Here and again in line 989 the phrase
            ‘under thy schelde’ means something like ‘in battle.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">773–74<space rend="indent1"/><p>If we translate the lines
            literally, line 774 must be taken as an almost meaningless metrical filler. It only
            makes sense if we extend the meaning of ‘tythynges’ beyond the ‘event’ or ‘news’ (the
            literal meaning) to those people who represent the new event referred to. They could
            come ‘with banners raised.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">856<space rend="indent1"/><p>This line presents some difficulty
            and may be corrupt. Herrtage admits in a note ‘I do not exactly understand this line’;
            and Mills glosses it only with a question mark. As it stands it seems to suggest that
            the sapphire presented to the Sultan is invisible.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="15">870<space rend="indent1"/><p>The word ‘lede’ normally means
            ‘people’; here it must mean something like ‘the customs of a people.’ Thus the line
            means: ‘They believed in heathen customs.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="16">878<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Whereals’ is used here in the sense
            of ‘where.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="17">913–16<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘kirtle’ is ‘a man’s tunic or
            coat which reached to the knees’; a ‘corset’ refers here to the ‘corslet’ which is ‘a
            piece of defensive armor covering the body’; an ‘acton’ is ‘a stuffed jacket or jerkin,
            at first of quilted cotton worn under the mail; also, in later times, a jacket of
            leather or other material plated with mail’; a ‘hauberk’ is a coat of mail; a ‘jazerant’
            or ‘jesserant’ is ‘a light coat of armor composed of splints or small plates of metal
            riveted to each other or to a lining of some stout material.’ (Definitions are from the
              <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>.)</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="18">957<space rend="indent1"/><p>The <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>
            defines ‘tepet’ (see under ‘tippet,’ where this line is cited) as ‘camail,’ which is ‘a
            piece of chain-mail armour attached to the basinet or head-piece, and protecting the
            neck and shoulders.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="19">976<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘gowere pendande’ is a ‘pendant
            attached to a coat of mail’ (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="20">997<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Famagose’ is Famagusta on
            Cypress.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="21">1163<space rend="indent1"/><p>There seems to be a connective
            missing at the beginning of this line (e.g., ‘for’). Mills translates ‘Because of the
            strength of its Saracen garrison.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="22">1233<space rend="indent1"/><p>In this line ‘baners’ must refer to
            the men assembled around the standard or the phrase ‘breme als bare’ would be a totally
            meaningless filler.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="23">1289<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage explains ‘bowes of devyce’
            as ‘cross-bows worked with a rack or winch.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="24">1298<space rend="indent1"/><p>The suffix ‘-warde’ is here
            separated from ‘fro’ (= ‘from’). Thus the line translates ‘And they ride away from the
            city.’ (Compare this line to line 1310: ‘Frowarde the cité ride.’)</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="25">1303<space rend="indent1"/><p>The word ‘browe’ does not fit the
            context since the spear wounded him in the side. Perhaps the correct reading is
            something like ‘brawne.’ Mills emends the word to ‘browne’ and translates the line:
            ‘Through the tough skin and unprotected flesh.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="26">1304<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘schaftemonde’ is ‘the distance
            from the end of the extended thumb to the opposite side of the hand, used as a measure =
            about 6 inches’ (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="27">1402<space rend="indent1"/><p>The definitions of ‘baneret’ in the
              <hi rend="italic">MED</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> indicate that the term
            is generally applied to a high order of knighthood. However, the context here makes it
            clear that Sir Barnarde is a standard bearer who has not yet achieved such distinction.
            He calls himself ‘over symple’ to refuse the task, as some other knights have, and asks
            to have the order of knighthood conferred on him for agreeing to deliver the
            message.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="28">1459<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘fewter’ is a support for a lance
