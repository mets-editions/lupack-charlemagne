        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

      <div type="text">
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">The romance known as <hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of
            Babylone</hi> survives in only one manuscript, Garrett No. 140, which passed from the
          Garrett collection in Baltimore to Princeton University. The manuscript dates from the
          mid-fifteenth century. The poem itself must have been written in the late fourteenth or
          the early fifteenth century since it contains echoes of Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic"
            >Canterbury Tales</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body" n="1"><hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi> is one of the many
          medieval tales dealing with the exploits of Charlemagne and his band of retainers known as
          the Twelve Peers. The most famous of the peers were Roland and Oliver, who are heroes of
            <hi rend="italic">The Song of Roland</hi>, the greatest of the medieval French epic
          poems or <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste</hi>. Written around 1100, <hi rend="italic"
            >The Song of Roland</hi> both brought to fruition a tradition of tales about Charlemagne
          and inspired others. In the twelfth century, as romance replaced epic, stories about
          Charlemagne and the Peers continued to be written. Charlemagne himself, who lived from
          742–814, was counted as one of the Nine Worthies, a group which included three personages
          from each of the classical, Biblical, and modern (i.e., medieval) worlds. This status
          ranked Charlemagne with such important figures as Hector, Alexander, Julius Caesar;
          Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus; Godfrey of Boulogne and Arthur. Perhaps only Arthur was of
          more importance to the medieval world than Charlemagne, who was, after all, credited with
          defending Christianity — and thus, for most medieval western readers, the civilized world
          — from the advancing Saracens, a more imminent and proximate threat than that which was
          met by the other Christian Worthies.</p>
        <p style="body" n="2">The stories about Charlemagne make up one of the three great ‘matters’
          (or subjects) of medieval romance, as defined by the thirteenth-century romance writer
          Jean Bodel in his <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Saisnes:</hi></p>
        <quote><lg>
            <l><hi rend="italic">N’en sont que trois materes a nul home entendant</hi></l>
            <l><hi rend="italic">De France, et de Bretaigne, et de Rome la grant.</hi></l>
          </lg></quote>
        <p style="bodysubsection" n="1">The stories clustered around Charlemagne make up the matter
          of France; stories about King Arthur and his knights, the matter of Britain; and stories
          of kings and heroes of the classical world, including Troy and Macedonia, the matter of
          Rome. The three matters are prominent in the medieval literature of England, Italy, and
          Germany, as well as France, though France often provides source versions for other
          vernacular literatures.</p>
        <p style="body" n="3">The English Charlemagne romances, which are generally translations or
          adaptations of French originals, may be divided into three groups. The first, of which <hi
            rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi> is a member, contains those in which the
          exploits of the son of the Sultan, Firumbras (or Ferumbras, as the name appears in <hi
            rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi>), are highlighted. (The other two groups will
          be discussed in the introductions to the other romances in this volume.) These are derived
          from the French romance <hi rend="italic">Fierebras</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">chanson de
            geste</hi> of the late twelfth century — although it is generally believed that <hi
            rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi> is based on an Anglo-Norman retelling of <hi
            rend="italic">Fierebras</hi> rather than directly on the French romance itself. The
          first part of <hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi>, dealing with the Saracen
          assault on Rome, has its ultimate source in the <hi rend="italic">Destruction de
          Rome</hi>, a French poem of about 1500 lines, which describes the sacking of Rome by the
          Saracens. The events of the <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> are introductory to those
          dealt with in <hi rend="italic">Fierebras</hi>. The Anglo-Norman manuscript on which the
            <hi rend="italic">Sowdone of Babylone</hi> is based abridges and adapts both of the
          French poems, which are, in turn, adapted by the English author of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Sowdone</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body" n="4">The poem is in an East Midland dialect. Thus we frequently find third
          person plural pronouns in <hi rend="italic">h</hi>- rather than <hi rend="italic">th</hi>-
          (as in ‘here’ = their; ‘hem’ = them; and, in l. 2698, ‘he’ = ‘they’); and the form of the
          third person singular feminine pronoun is ‘she’ (rather than the northern form ‘scho’ or
          the southern and western form ‘heo’). In the third person singular of the present, the
          verb generally ends in <hi rend="italic">-th</hi> (as in ‘King Lowes witnessith’ and
          ‘corage begynneth’); and in the plural the ending is -<hi rend="italic">en</hi> (as in
          ‘frith and felde wexen’ and ‘lovers slepen’). The present participle ends sometimes in
            -<hi rend="italic">ing(e)</hi> or -<hi rend="italic">yng(e)</hi> (as in ‘gyvinge’ and
          ‘seynge’) and sometimes in -<hi rend="italic">and(e)</hi> (as in ‘cryande’ and
          ‘prikande’), as is typical of the East Midland dialect.</p>
        <p style="body" n="5">Despite the fact that <hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi>
          is derived from earlier works, there is a degree of liveliness and originality in the
          narrative that makes it interesting in its own right. It is, after all, a poem whose scope
          borders on the epic. The Saracen threat to Christendom, which must have been perceived in
          the Middle Ages much as the Communist threat to the free world was in America in the
          1950s, concerned not only the fate of a country but the survival of the way of life that
          most in the western world knew. The conflict thus takes on the overtones of a world war.
          The fighting takes place in Rome and in Spain; and Charlemagne’s French troops must battle
          forces assembled from all over the Saracen world. The Sultan’s vassals come from Asia,
          Asia Minor, northern Africa and parts of Europe. As W. R. J. Barron observes, the romance
          ‘disarms criticism of its improbable events by the sweep of its narrative’ (p. 102).</p>
        <p style="body" n="6">This sweep allows the author to introduce exotic details that must
          have had a great appeal to the medieval reader. Indeed, some of them still seem
          interesting devices for revealing the alien nature of the people that Charlemagne must
          fight. When Laban, the Sultan, eats serpents fried in oil, or when he makes his vassals
          drink the blood of tigers, antelopes, and giraffes to inspire their courage, or when the
          seven-month-old children of a giant in the Sultan’s service are said to be fourteen feet
          long, the audience, medieval or modern, experiences a fearful fascination.</p>
        <p style="body" n="7">But between the extremes of epic scope and exotic detail, there are
          other virtues to the narrative. There is in the romance a distinctive sense of character.
          One of the most interesting characters is Floripas, Laban’s daughter. The motivation for
          her betrayal is slight: in a parody of courtly love, her affection for Guy of Burgundy,
          whom she has never seen, leads her to assist the Twelve Peers and frustrate the Sultan’s
          plans to put them to death. But she is a striking example of a resourceful and independent
          female character as she aids her father’s enemies.</p>
        <p style="body" n="8">When Laban is about to kill Roland and Oliver, Floripas advises him to
          keep them as hostages and then sets about to free them from the suffering and misery of
          their captivity. When her governess refuses to join in her plot, Floripas, on the pretext
          of having her watch porpoises at play, brings her to a window and shoves her out into the
          sea so that the governess will not betray her. To gain custody of the prisoners, she slays
          the jailer and convinces her father that she did so because he had fed the prisoners even
          though ordered not to by the Sultan.</p>
        <p style="body" n="9">She lends similar aid to the rest of the Peers when they become
          prisoners. Supplying them with food and armor, she allows them to hold out against the
          Sultan until assistance from Charlemagne arrives. When supplies run out, she has in
          reserve a magic girdle that makes anyone who puts it on feel as if he has just eaten his
          fill. And when the Sultan’s men are about to break into the castle, she devises the
          stratagem of hurling down the Sultan’s treasure and thus ending the attack as his soldiers
          scramble to get as much of the gold and silver as they can.</p>
        <p style="body" n="10">Floripas is in some ways a character as important in the romance as
          her brother Ferumbras. And the two together make Charlemagne’s victory possible. Ferumbras
          might be seen as the <hi rend="italic">fortitudo</hi> that complements Floripas’ <hi
            rend="italic">sapientia</hi> (or at least cunning). He is valiant in battle. He
          overcomes the Pope and has him at his mercy but scorns to kill a cleric and so spares him.
          He engages in a fierce combat with Oliver, as a result of which he decides to convert to
          Christianity and to assist the French forces. He even saves the life of Charlemagne who is
          abandoned in the midst of his foes because of the treachery of Ganelyne (the Ganelon whose
          villainous behavior is traditional in Charlemagne tales from <hi rend="italic">The Song of
            Roland</hi> on).</p>
        <p style="body" n="11">Of course, the conversion of his two children to the religion he
          hates is one of the greatest defeats that Laban suffers. The conversion of the children of
          the leader of the Saracens is a symbolic victory for the forces of Christianity,
          especially since almost all the Charlemagne romances are couched in terms of a religious
          struggle, even when they are not specifically <hi rend="italic">about</hi> religion. The
          conversion also provides one of the thematic links between the two parts of the poem.
          Early in the narrative, the Sultan said to Ferumbras, ‘My joy is alle in the nowe here /
          And in my doghter Dame Floripas’ (ll. 95–96). This statement echoes throughout the
          romance, right up to the end when he has no joy left and can only curse his son and
          daughter, calling her a ‘hore serpentine’ and him ‘fals cursed Ferumbras’ (ll.
          3171–72).</p>
        <p style="body" n="12">Charlemagne and Laban are poles apart not only at the end of the
          romance, but throughout. Charlemagne can be unreasonable, as he is when he insists on
          sending all his Peers as messengers to Laban merely because each of them objected that it
          was foolhardy to send anyone to a man known to slay the messengers of his foes. But he is
          unswerving in his faith. He prays to Christ to give Oliver victory in his struggle with
          Ferumbras, and an angel comes to tell him his prayer has been heard. Laban, on the other
          hand, is repeatedly defying and denying his gods when he does not receive the results he
          has prayed for. When he is forced to flee his castle because of his daughter’s betrayal,
          he tells the gods that they sleep too long and threatens to forsake them all if they don’t
          help him. When the Peers sally forth and obtain provisions, Laban is so enraged that he
          threatens to burn the images of his deities and renounce them all. He goes so far as to
          have a fire prepared before his priests intervene and convince him to repent and to make a
          conciliatory offering. Yet again when his treasure is thrown from the castle, Laban is so
          angry with his gods that he strikes the statue of Mahound and knocks it to the ground.</p>
        <p style="body" n="13">In the end, Laban can neither be faithful to his own gods nor accept
          the Christian faith. He spits into the font in which Charlemagne intends to have him
          baptized and, being recalcitrant, must be executed. His soul is taken off to join the
          devils in hell while Charlemagne, having rescued the relics stolen by the Saracens from
          Rome, entrusts the holy objects to churches throughout France.</p>
        <p style="body" n="14">While Barron is probably correct in saying that religion is not the
          real interest of <hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi>, it does play a part in
          defining the characters of Laban and of Charlemagne and in emphasizing the difference in
          their causes. And it is this polarity that forms the thematic center of the poem. Elements
          beyond religion enter into the contrast. One of the most important is the matching of
          words and works. The impetus for all the action of the romance is the robbing of the
          wealth on one of the Sultan’s ships by the Romans, for which he vows to be avenged. But
          his life becomes a study in frustration. While his vow seems to be fulfilled by the
          sacking of Rome, he is ultimately thwarted in achieving his revenge by Charlemagne and his
          Peers, and, worse, by his own children. Laban vows to Mahound that Oliver and Roland will
          be slain, but is dissuaded by his daughter, whose betrayal assures that they never will be
          executed. And later he swears that he will hang Charlemagne unless he will return
          Ferumbras and leave his territory. Of course, Charlemagne is never hung. Even Laban’s
          threats against his gods are never carried out.</p>
        <p style="body" n="15">What develops is a pattern of rash speech which Laban does not have
          the power to translate into deeds. Charlemagne is just the opposite. What he says comes to
          pass, even if it is the rash demand that his Peers take a message to Laban. Perhaps most
          important in this regard and most revealing as a point of comparison is Charlemagne’s vow
          (sworn ‘by God and Seinte Denis,’ not by Mahound) that unless Laban will be baptized and
          renounce his false faith, he will never see Babylon again (cf. ll. 761–766). This is
          precisely what happens. At the end of the romance, when Laban refuses to convert to
          Christianity, he is put to death.</p>
        <p style="body" n="16">The contrasting vows and attitudes towards the gods and religion
          demonstrate that <hi rend="italic">The Sowdone of Babylone</hi> is not as poorly
          structured as might first appear. There is at work in the poem a common medieval
          structural principle by which meaning is revealed through a series of comparisons and
          contrasts. The poem can be seen as a kind of diptych in which Charlemagne appears in one
          panel and Laban in the other. By means of parallel incidents, statements, and
          relationships with characters, certain qualities in the two and the worlds they represent
          are emphasized. Through these contrasts the poem comes full circle, and order, disturbed
          and threatened with extinction at the beginning of the poem, is restored in the end.</p>
