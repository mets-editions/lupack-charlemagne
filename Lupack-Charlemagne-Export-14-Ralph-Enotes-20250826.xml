        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

      <div type="text">
        <note type="enote" n="1">4<space rend="indent1"/><p>The phrase ‘fra Sanct Thomas’ has been
            variously interpreted. Amours takes it to refer to the date of the feast of St. Thomas
            the Apostle, December 21. Walsh follows Browne in reading it as suggesting that those
            referred to are returning from a pilgrimage to Canterbury, where the tomb of St. Thomas
            à Becket is located. Bawcutt and Riddy suggest that the phrase seems to refer to a place
            and note the suggestion of H. M. Smyser that ‘Thomas’ be emended to ‘Dyonys.’ Speed’s
            observation that the reference to the pilgrimage would be a literary device recalling
            Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> is worth keeping in mind. She also
            notes that ‘Charlemagne lived and died almost four hundred years before Thomas B Becket
            but such anachronism is familiar in medieval literature.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">5<space rend="indent1"/><p>The second ‘thay’ in this line means
            ‘those,’ as it does again in l. 20 (second ‘thay’) and in l. 22 and elsewhere in the
            text. In l. 21 the ‘thay’ should be translated ‘that’ since ‘wedderis’ (technically a
            plural) has the singular sense of ‘storm.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">10<space rend="indent1"/><p>On ‘duchepeiris,’ see the note to <hi
              rend="italic">Sowdone of Babylone</hi>, l. 241 (commenting on the ‘Dosipers,’ an
            alternate spelling of the same word).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">17<space rend="indent1"/><p>The first ‘deip’ in the line has been
            emended by Speed to ‘drip’ and by Bawcutt and Riddy to ‘drift.’ Herrtage maintains
            ‘deip’ but glosses it only with a question mark. Walsh suggests that the word may be ‘a
            noun or nominalized adjective meaning that the snow was being driven in the “deep
            places,” — valleys and rock chasms.’ This is surely the sense of the line, but the first
            ‘deip’ (assuming the reading is correct) must refer to the snow itself which has mounted
            up in the ‘mony deip dell.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">23<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Prime’ is the canonical hour, the
            fixed part of the Divine Office to be sung or recited at a specific time, for the first
            hour of the day (6 a.m. or sunrise).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">46<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘collier’ is one who makes and sells
            charcoal.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">63<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Sanct July’ is Saint Julian the
            Hospitaller, the patron saint of inn keepers and travellers.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">96<space rend="indent1"/><p>The phrase ‘cheveris with the chin’ is
            the equivalent of ‘our teeth are chattering.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">123<space rend="indent1"/><p>When ‘part’ is used with a cardinal
            number, it indicates ‘a proportion one measure short of a whole’ (<hi rend="italic"
              >MED</hi>). Thus ‘twa part’ is literally ‘two-thirds.’ The sense of the phrase is
            probably best conveyed in modern English by the translation of Bawcutt and Riddy: ‘more
            than half annoyed.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">126<space rend="indent1"/><p>This line alludes to a proverb:
            ‘Nature ought to crawl where it cannot walk.’ The line translates: “‘Now is one time
            when,’ said the Collier, ‘nature ought to crawl.’” The suggestion is that his guest’s
            natural courtesy should lead him to act in a way that is appropriate to the
            circumstances even if different from his normal way of doing things.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">147<space rend="indent1"/><p>In this line ‘fair’ seems to be used
            in the sense of a ‘fuss’ and ‘strange’ in the sense of ‘alien’; thus the line suggests
            that by offering to let Rauf go before him, Charlemagne is once again extending a
            courtesy that is inappropriate to the circumstances and thus not really a courtesy at
            all.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">235<space rend="indent1"/><p>The shrine of Saint James the Apostle
            at Compostela was a famous pilgrimage site. According to medieval legend, James preached
            the gospel in Spain and even fought against the Moors.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">239<space rend="indent1"/><p>The Wardrobe is ‘the office or
            department of a royal or noble household charged with the care of the wearing apparel’
              (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">309–10<space rend="indent1"/><p>These lines are difficult to make
            sense of as they stand in other editions (‘For thow will never gif the mair / To make
            ane lesing’). Browne suggested translating them as ‘Thou wilt nevermore undertake (give
            thyself) to tell a lie.’ Speed translates: ‘for you will never again undertake (<hi
              rend="italic">literally</hi>, give yourself) to tell a lie.’ Walsh proposes
            translating: ‘You won’t give yourself anymore trouble by telling a lie.’ None of these
            interpretations makes much sense in the context. However, by emending ‘ane’ to ‘nane’
            and taking line 310 as a filler of the type employed by the poet in several other
            places, the lines make perfect sense. Rauf says, in effect, ‘I’ll surely be there
            tomorrow because you will never give any more, in truth [literally, to make no lie].’
            That is, he can never expect to receive more than on the day after he has offered
            shelter to his guest.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="15">344–45<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘convent’ of priests would be
            those living together in one religious community. The phrase ‘at ane sicht’ might mean
            that the priests are dressed in vestments (‘revest’) uniformly (as Speed suggests), or
            it might depend on the verb ‘se’ — i.e., they were seen ‘at a glance’ or ‘all together’
            (as Browne translates).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="16">352<space rend="indent1"/><p>On St. Denis see the note to <hi
              rend="italic">Sowdone of Babylone</hi>, l. 27.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="17">370<space rend="indent1"/><p>Walsh and Speed both suggest that the
            line implies that Gyliane thinks their guest didn’t return the blow because she was
            present. It is also possible that the line might originally have read ‘and he ne had
            bene allane’; that is, if he had his fellow courtiers with him, as he will when Rauf
            journeys to court, he would have punished Rauf for his insolence.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="18">374<space rend="indent1"/><p>Amours suggests that ‘layd’ is a
            contraction of ‘lay it’ (i.e., stake it [my life]).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="19">391<space rend="indent1"/><p>Browne suggests that here and in l.
            481 ‘thing’ is used to refer to a person.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="20">423<space rend="indent1"/><p>The line translates literally: ‘Then
            bade him to cease his courtesy and prepare to go.’ That is, Roland wants Rauf to stop
            kneeling to him, rise and prepare to go with him to court.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="21">441<space rend="indent1"/><p>Bawcutt and Riddy, following Laing,
            gloss ‘mad’ as ‘simple.’ The term thus refers to Rauf who says he is just a simple man.
            Walsh and Speed make ‘mad man’ direct address, referring to Roland. In their reading,
            Rauf, responding to Roland’s ‘sic ten’ in the previous line, says, ‘I am only one, mad
            man. . . .’ Though the meaning ‘simple’ would be unusual for ‘mad’ something like
            ‘foolish’ is elsewhere attested and ‘simple’ is not an unreasonable extension of that
            meaning.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="22">450<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘To Wymond nor Will’ means ‘to Wymond
            nor to anyone else.’ The common name ‘Will’ is used much as we would use ‘Tom, Dick and
            Harry.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="23">461<space rend="indent1"/><p>Bawcutt and Riddy are probably
            correct in taking ‘sene’ as ‘seen’ (used pleonastically).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="24">469<space rend="indent1"/><p>The line either means that Roland’s
            greaves (the armor worn on the leg, below the knee) are [like] great clasps of gold
            indeed; or, as Speed suggests (following Amours and Browne), the word ‘on’ has been
            omitted and the line means that there are great clasps of gold <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
            his greaves.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="25">473<space rend="indent1"/><p>The line, which translates ‘tied all
            over with topazes and true-love knots together,’ probably means that the topazes were
            arranged in the shape of true-love knots, which the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> defines
            as knots ‘of a complicated and ornamental form (usually either a double-looped bow, or a
            knot formed of two loops intertwined), used as a symbol of true love.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="26">511<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Mat’ (meaning ‘obstruct’ or
            ‘checkmate,’ as in chess) is emended to ‘mar’ by Walsh and by Bawcutt and
          Riddy.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="27">521<space rend="indent1"/><p>Editors generally take ‘toun man’ to
            mean a resident of a town as opposed to someone living in the country, but the context
            would seem to suggest that Roland sees Rauf as an example of a ‘toun man’ and not
            different from one. <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> gives as one meaning of ‘town’ ‘a farm
            with its farmhouse’ and notes that it still has this meaning in the Scottish dialect.
            This is surely the sense intended here.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="28">533<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘By books and bells’ is a mild oath.
            Roland is swearing by sacred books and church bells.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="29">563<space rend="indent1"/><p>The earliest reading ‘bland’ is
            generally emended by modern editors to ‘band.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="30">611<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage glosses ‘gift’ as ‘message.’
            This is the sense of the word in this context, if not the literal meaning. The thing
            that the swain has to give is the message about Rauf. The word was probably chosen more
            for alliteration than for connotation.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="31">613<space rend="indent1"/><p>The word ‘leif’ is taken by Walsh to
            mean ‘leave’; the line then translates literally: ‘Unless he is let in quickly, he
            doesn’t want to leave.’ Bawcutt and Riddy take it as ‘live’ and translate: ‘Unless he is
            let in straight away, he does not want to go on living.’ The latter seems to make the
            line coincide more naturally with modern English syntax, but the former seems more in
            keeping with Rauf’s character.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="32">619<space rend="indent1"/><p>The phrase ‘on ground’ means
            literally ‘on the ground’ or ‘on the earth’ but here is an almost meaningless line
            filler. The same might be said of ‘in this stound’ in the next line.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="33">701<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Can’ is used here as an auxiliary
            indicating the past tense (the equivalent of ‘did’). The line thus translates: ‘He
            thrust in through them and eagerly pushed.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="34">731<space rend="indent1"/><p>The phrase ‘and sa strait ford’ has
            been interpreted in several different ways. Herrtage takes ‘ford’ as meaning ‘road’ or
            ‘way’ and the phrase as meaning ‘so severe was the way.’ Bawcutt and Riddy take ‘ford’
            to mean ‘for it’ and consider this a pleonastic expression; thus ‘strait,’ like ‘fell,’
            would modify ‘frostis.’ Walsh reads ‘strait ford’ as ‘straight forth’; Charlemagne told
            how he met Rauf, how fierce the frost was, and so straight forth (to the end of his
            story). Herrtage’s reading, though apparently rejected by later editors, does fit the
            context of the King’s story quite well.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="35">760<space rend="indent1"/><p>A ‘forfeiture’ is an estate
            confiscated as punishment for a crime; a ‘free ward’ is the estate of a deceased tenant
            who did not have an heir old enough to inherit the property; in this case the control of
            the land would revert to the overlord.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="36">762<space rend="indent1"/><p>To ‘have hy’ is literally to ‘have
            haste’; Speed seems to capture the sense of the phrase best with her gloss of ‘have
            urgent need.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="37">765<space rend="indent1"/><p>To ‘win one’s shoes’ implies proving

        <note type="enote" n="38">782<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Gest’ probably means ‘guest’ here;
            but Browne takes it as ‘jest.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="39">822<space rend="indent1"/><p>Herrtage and Bawcutt and Riddy read
            ‘bair’; Speed, following Browne, emends to ‘baft’ (‘struck’) and Walsh to ‘bait.’ The
            basic sense of the line does not change whichever of these readings we accept: ‘These
            men rained blows on [each other’s] helmets before they stopped.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="40">850<space rend="indent1"/><p>Mahoun (Mahomet or Mohammed) and
            Termagant were thought to be gods worshipped by the Saracens.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="41">861<space rend="indent1"/><p>Speed takes ‘Rude’ to mean ‘a rod’ (a
            measure equivalent to sixteen and a half feet). But, considering the religious nature of
            the conflict, the meaning of ‘Cross’ might apply equally well: ‘He made him move back
            the length of a broad Cross.’ (Browne translates ‘Rude braid’ as
          ‘Rood-breadth.’)</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="42">882<space rend="indent1"/><p>Walsh notes that Browne thought
            ‘breif’ to be an error for ‘brey’ (frighten) and that the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary
              of the Older Scottish Tongue</hi> cites this use of ‘breif’ as a possible erroneous
            form. But it is likely that Bawcutt and Riddy are correct in reading ‘breif’ as a form
            of ‘breven,’ which is commonly used in alliterative verse to mean ‘repeat or tell.’
            Their extension of the meaning to ‘address’ in this line seems plausible.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="43">886<space rend="indent1"/><p>Walsh cites Browne’s observation that
            the line ‘the tane is in power to mak that presoun’ would make better sense if the poet
            had written ‘the’ instead of ‘that’ but does not emend the line. Only Bawcutt and Riddy
            emend to ‘the.’ I follow them in so emending. It seems an obvious slip to have read
            ‘that’ instead of ‘the’ — especially given the appearance of the word ‘that’ in the
            previous and the following lines. The line then translates: ‘The one of us has the power
            to make you a prisoner.’</p></note>

            Sea. . . . First known in the West as applied to the mingled host of Mongols, Tartars,
            Turks, etc., which under the leadership of Jenghiz Khan (1202–1227) overran and
            devastated much of Asia and Eastern Europe . . .’ (<hi rend="italic"

            an ‘obvious error’ and emend to ‘gold,’ as do Walsh and Speed. However, ‘god’ in the

        <note type="enote" n="47">957<space rend="indent1"/><p>It is interesting that Magog is given
            ‘Gawteir’ as his Christian name. In the <hi rend="italic">Sege of Melayne</hi> there is
            reference to a ‘Sir Gawtere’ as a close relative of Charlemagne (ll. 377–378). Though
            the characters can not be one and the same, it seems clear that the author of <hi
