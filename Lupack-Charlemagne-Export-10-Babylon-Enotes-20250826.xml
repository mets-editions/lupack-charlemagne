        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

      <div type="text">
        <note type="enote" n="1">27<space rend="indent1"/><p>Denis was the patron saint of France.
            In 626 Dagobert I founded the Abbey of Saint-Denis in Paris at the site where St. Denis
            was believed to be buried.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">32<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Askalon’ or Ascalon is a city in
            Palestine, north of Gaza, on the Mediterranean. It was captured by Crusaders in 1153 and
            recaptured by Saladin in 1187. The city is referred to again in line 1000
            (‘Ascoloyne’).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">46<space rend="indent1"/><p>Cf. the ‘General Prologue’ to the <hi
              rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> (lines 9–11), where Chaucer refers to this belief
            that nightingales sleep with an open eye.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">56<space rend="indent1"/><p>An ‘alaunt’ is ‘a highly prized
            ferocious dog of a breed used in hunting, bull-baiting, etc.’; a ‘lymmer’ is ‘a hound
            trained to be led on a leash and to track game by scent’; ‘racche’ refers to ‘a dog that
            hunts by scent’ (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">86<space rend="indent1"/><p>Mahounde and Appolyne (Apollo) are gods
            thought to be worshipped by the Saracens.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">113<space rend="indent1"/><p>Baldas is probably Bagdad. In <hi
              rend="italic">The Alliterative Morte Arthure</hi>, the form ‘Baldake’ (for Bagdad)
            appears. The fact that Lucafere is also called ‘That cruel kinge of Cassaundre’ (line
            986) does not necessarily argue against identifying Baldas as Bagdad. Cassaundre is
            probably Cassandria in Macedonia. However, Lucafere, who is also ‘Of Aufryke lorde and
            governoure’ (line 114), seems to have been granted many lands because of his prowess. It
            is also possible that the poet made Lucafere king of Cassaundre because he needed a
            rhyme for ‘Alisaundre’ in line 984.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">127<space rend="indent1"/><p>The maintop is a platform at the head
            of the mainmast.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">148<space rend="indent1"/><p>Here, as often in the romance, ‘gan’
            is used as an auxiliary to indicate a past tense, much as we might use ‘did.’</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">241<space rend="indent1"/><p>The ‘Dosipers’ are the Twelve Peers or
            principal warriors of Charlemagne. The term, from the French ‘douze pairs,’ comes to be
            used as a synonym for ‘peer’ or ‘knight,’ so that we often find the etymologically
            redundant ‘Twelve Dosipers,’ as we do here. In the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de
              Roland</hi>, the Twelve Peers are said to be Roland, Olivier, Gérin, Gérier,
            Bérengier, Otton, Samson, Engelier, Ivon, Ivoire, Anséis, and Girard. The list varies in
            different works. In this romance, as lines 1688 ff. suggest, the Twelve Peers are
            Roland, Oliver, Gy of Burgoyne, Duke Neymes of Baver, Ogere Danoys, Bery Lardeneys, Folk
            Baliant, Aleroyse, Miron of Brabane, Bishop Turpyn, Bernard of Spruwse and Bryere of
            Mountez.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">257<space rend="indent1"/><p>The ‘Gallopes’ are perhaps the people
            from Gallipoli on the Southern shore of the Gallipolli Peninsula, at the east end of the
            Dardanelles.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">495<space rend="indent1"/><p>The correct reading here is probably
            ‘Ascopars’ rather than the ms. ‘Astopars.’ Forms of the name with the <hi rend="italic"
              >c</hi> appear, as Hausknecht notes, in lines 2196 and 2648. A similar confusion
            between <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> takes place in line 1424
            (where I have again emended to read ‘Ascopartes’). The Ascopartes are apparently a
            fearsome race of giants subject to the Sultan.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">497<space rend="indent1"/><p>‘Askalous’ are people from Askalon
            (see note to line 32), also referred to as ‘Ascoloynes’ in line 1040.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">561<space rend="indent1"/><p>Matins is the first of the canonical
            hours (i. e., the fixed parts of the Divine Office to be recited or sung at specified
            hours of the day). Matins is followed by lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers and
            compline.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">628–34<space rend="indent1"/><p>To hold ‘in fee’ means to possess
            ‘by a heritable right subject to feudal obligations’ (see <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>,
            ‘fee,’ sb. 2, 1b).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="15">663<space rend="indent1"/><p>St. Peter’s Basilica was built by the
            Emperor Constantine (beginning c. 324) and completed by his son Constantius (in c. 354).
            Tradition says it was built over the grave of Peter the Apostle.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="16">689<space rend="indent1"/><p>Smyser sees details such as the
            reference to the Saracens’ cry of ‘antrarian’ to signify ‘joye generalle’ as a sign that
            the author took ‘an innocent if slightly ostentatious delight in airing his learning of
            things Saracen’ (p. 209).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="17">850<space rend="indent1"/><p>There seems to be some confusion in
            this poem between Charlemagne’s sword ‘Joyeuse’ and the battle cry of his troops,
            ‘Monjoie.’ The identification of the two by the poet is paralleled by a linking of the
            two in the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland</hi> (see line 2510). The battle cry is
            derived, according to one theory, from Monte Gaudia, the hill from which pilgrims first
            see the eternal city. Another theory suggests that a ‘montjoie’ was ‘a mound or cairn of
            stones set up to mark the site of a victory’ and that the cry ‘Montjoie St.-Denis’ or,
            in a shortened form, ‘Montjoie’ ‘derived from the cairn set up at Saint-Denis on the
            site of the saint’s martyrdom (his spiritual victory)’ (see Dorothy Sayers’ translation

            called Saint-Quentin (Aisne).’ Legend makes him ‘a Roman citizen who came to preach the
            Gospel in Gaul with St. Lucian of Beauvais; Quentin preached at Amiens where the

            There are, however, other places in the text where the rhyme is less than perfect. If he
            is correct, it may be that the scribe substituted the name of Fremund because he was an
            English saint. Though he may have been a fictional character, he was reputedly,
            according to the <hi rend="italic">Oxford Dictionary of Saints</hi>, ‘a relative of
            Offa, king of Mercia, and of Edmund, king of East Anglia [who] became a hermit. But as
